# Subnetting Tool for Network Address Analysis  
This is a simple script hosted at http://robkau.github.io/subnetting_tool to perform analysis of a given network address and subnet mask. 

Looking back from 2021, this is one of the first webpages I ever built while just barely learning javascript and hoping I could be a programmer someday. 
If I was to write this again, the code would be so much cleaner ðŸ˜ƒ. 
How time flies.
