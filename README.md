# Subnetting Tool for Network Address Analysis  
This is a simple script hosted at http://robkau.github.io/subnetting_tool to perform analysis of a given network address and subnet mask. 

Looking back from 2022, this is one of the first webpages I ever built while just barely learning javascript and hoping I could be a programmer someday. 
How time flies.
